This is a basic password manager, it allows the user to create passwords and save them. They are also able to see all saved passwords.

The program creates a hashed key file, which is then used to encrypt the saved passwords. The program also uses the hashed key to read the encrypted passwords.

There are many improvements to be made for this program. First of all, the program should have a password checker that gives the passwords a rating, and show the user how safe their password is. Some minor improvements also include a link to this repository to verify the integrity of the program. Some better GUI when the passwords are displayed would make the program a lot more user friendly. 
Those are the improvements that I have in mind and will try to achieve in the future, if you have any suggestions let me know!.
